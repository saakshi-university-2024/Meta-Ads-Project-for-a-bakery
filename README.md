# 📊 Consumer Behavior–Driven A/B Testing Campaign

This project conducted a real-world A/B testing campaign for a premium European-style bakery, as part of a course on Consumer Behavior at Purdue University. The campaign was designed to understand how ad messaging impacts engagement using Expectancy Theory as the behavioral framework.

## 🧠 Project Objective

- Increase Instagram profile visits for the bakery
- Compare impact of traditional caption vs. customer review–based caption using Meta Ads
- Derive data-backed insights segmented by age and gender

## 📌 Key Features

- **Behavioral Framework**: Based on Victor Vroom's *Expectancy Theory*
- **Ad Design**: Control (descriptive caption) vs. Test (5-star Yelp review)
- **Targeting**: Lafayette-area residents via Meta Ads
- **Data Segmentation**: Gender x Age (18–65+)
- **Performance Metrics**: CTR, cost per result, impressions

## 📈 Impact & Results
