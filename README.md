# Consumer Behavior–Driven A/B Testing Campaign

This project conducted a real-world A/B testing campaign for a premium European-style bakery, as part of a course on Consumer Behavior at Purdue University. The campaign was designed to understand how ad messaging impacts engagement using Expectancy Theory as the behavioral framework.

## Project Objective

- Increase Instagram profile visits for the bakery
- Compare impact of traditional caption vs. customer review–based caption using Meta Ads
- Derive data-backed insights segmented by age and gender

## Key Features

- **Behavioral Framework**: Based on Victor Vroom's *Expectancy Theory*
- **Ad Design**: Control (descriptive caption) vs. Test (5-star Yelp review)
- **Targeting**: Lafayette-area residents via Meta Ads
- **Data Segmentation**: Gender x Age (18–65+)
- **Performance Metrics**: CTR, cost per result, impressions

## Impact & Results

- Test ad achieved **3.5% CTR** vs. 2.2% for control
- **21.5% CTR** among men aged 25–34 in the test group
- New Instagram followers gained during campaign
- Increased Instagram engagement with **4,000+ new impressions**
- Cost per result improved significantly for test ad
